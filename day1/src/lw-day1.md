# Introduction

## On "Learning Linux"

You can use the GUI. You can download things from the internet. You can effectively use Linux like Windows.

HOWEVER, "Learning Linux" makes your life easier.

- Manually search through tons of folders and files => a little CLI-fu
- Updating & installing programs is slow and tedious => sudo apt install x
- "Oh god why is my machine broken" => Seeing the exact error message

The best way to learn? Ask questions & practice skills to solve everyday problems.

- How to find files from terminal? Practice it!
- Something broke. How do I fix it? Investigate it!
- I want to change something on my system. Research it!

It is 2026, not 2006. Use the internet!

TL;DR: Learn by doing!

# The Technical Answer

## The Kernel

Any answer given short of a lecture will be riddled with asterisks.

- Manages Memory
- Schedules threads, processes
- Filesystem


## Linux Distros

Package Managers

# The Philosophical Answer

## Free, as in Libre

::: columns
:::: column
**Windows**

- Effectively monetarily free, still requires you trick activation server
- Random updates at worst possible moment
- Always forcing new Microsoft bloat down your throat:
  - Copilot
  - OneDrive EVERYTHING
  - Start menu now searches internet!?
- Something broke? Pray its just Windows being Windows

MacOS is locked to Apple Hardware.

**Linux**

- GPLv2: Copyleft
  - TL;DR: Go crazy as long as you GPLv2 your code & open source it
- Something broke?
  - Everything that your system has done since boot has been logged.
  - 99% chance that your problem has an Arch Wiki article.
- "Windows supports so much more!"
  - Community patches, Containerization, Proton
  - Mainly CAD & Adobe Suite Software stuck on Windows

## Open Source

- Ricing
- Code editor
- Community Support
- Security

# The Practical Answer

## Not Windows.

Things will take time to get used to.

- Command Line
- Package Manager
- Setting some things up by hand

However, a lot of things will be better!

- Super efficient
- FOSS Ecosystem

## Where to start?

Ubuntu & Mint are common for good reason. I'd recommend Mint over Ubuntu.

Many people try to "learn Linux". What they generally mean is they want to learn:

- How to get comfy with the command line?
- How do I fix problems?
- What does a free operating system even mean for me?
