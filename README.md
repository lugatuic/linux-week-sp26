Location: CDRLC 1413

## Event Schedule

### Day One: What is Linux?

Maybe you're a CS Major, listening to your friend wax poetic about how Linux is *so much better* than Windows or MacOS. Maybe you're just sick of Windows 11 requiring you give it a huge chunk of your ram and installing Copilot on your PC without asking. Either way, you've definitely asked yourself, "What is Linux?", once or twice.

Want a straight answer, aimed at explaining why people bother to use it, why it is so prevalent, and what the difference between different distros is? Join us on Monday, February 2nd, at 4 PM in CDRLC 1413 to learn more! You will learn about the basics of Linux without being talked down to or being told to just "use this because I said so."

### Day Two: Demystifying the Command Line

### Day Three: Intro to Scripting

### Day Four: Using the Package Manager
